Good morning everyone my names Fletcher and today im going to be showing you my bank account management app
I only have 5 mins so im gonna go fast, there will be time for questions at the end

This was built as a simple maven project using java 8, and utilizes JDBC to connect to a postgresql database hosted on AWS

To begin we need to add a person to our person database,
we need to know a little bit about who you are before we let you apply for an account

a
hong
wu
hongwu

*show the user_info table in DBeaver*
then we can apply to create a checking or savings account for hong

c
4
hongwu
password
c
c

this will create an account application which must be approved by an employee or admin
*show the account_applications table in DBeaver*
as you can see, hongs application was added

next lets login to the employee1 account which already exists to accept hongs application

l
employee1
employee1
2

this takes me to the employee menu

4
a

as you can see hongs application was removed from the list, and a checkings account was created for him
*show the account_applications table in DBeaver*
*show the account_info table in DBeaver*

lets go login to hongs account now and make some transactions

*exit to homepage*

l
hongwu
password

as you can see, since hong is a customer he has a different menu available to him than my admin account
now lets make a deposit

1
100

*show the account_info table in DBeaver*
we deposited a little too much so now lets withdraw some

2
20.21

lastly, lets transfer some of hongs money over to employee1

3
1
13.37

*show the account_info table in DBeaver*
as you can see, the money has been successfully transferred to employee1

lastly, lets go to the admin menu and delete hongs account because he committed tax fraud

4
l
admin1
admin1

*show the account_info table in DBeaver*
lets take one last look at the account_info table
as you can see, hongs account is now gone

that is all the time i have, any questions?
